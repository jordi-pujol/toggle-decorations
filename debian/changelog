toggle-decorations (1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now setnewwinprops uses the C program toggle-decorations.c to set or unset
    window decorations. This C program was done by muktupavels.
    However, toggle-decorations is not part of this package because it's build for
    all architectures.
    setnewwinprops may use an alternative method to set or unset
    window decorations tappping keys in the window menu. 
    Will build toggle-decorations in a separate package.
